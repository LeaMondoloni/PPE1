   "I am a very big fan of nerdy day trips," says Ben Goldacre, journalist
   and author, who's built a massive user-generated map of places for
   geeks to go.

   In a post on his blog, he describes how he's a fan of abandoned nuclear
   bunkers, sea forts, victorian racecourses, and narrow-gauge railways
   that take you to a power station. We are too, so we wanted to highlight
   the impressive map that he's put together of nerdy landmarks in
   Britain.

   He built it with the help of Jo Brodie, who compiled all the
   suggestions (coming in through Goldacre's blog comments and

   two hashtags) onto a Google map. You can see that map here, and add
   your own suggestions.

   Goldacre says on his blog: "We really want to gather as many as
   possible of the more obscure ones, the clearing with the abandoned
   factory, a strange earth feature of nerd interest, the terrifying power
   station, the water slide park, and so on. Our fantasy is that on any
   given road trip, you will be able to find a nerd stop somewhere along
   your route, or perhaps even plot out a nerd odyssey across the UK."

   To contribute to the map, either tweet the info and location using the
   #nerdytrips hashtag, or add your destinations directly onto the map.
